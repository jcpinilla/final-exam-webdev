# Final Exam
This project was made during the course of [Web Dev]( http://johnguerra.co/classes/webDevelopment_spring_2018/) at Universidad de los Andes. With this app, you will be able to visualize the schedule of different agencies and routes taken from the nextbus API. Select an agency and/or a route from the lists and it will display a TimeTable showing the expected arrival time for the buses in their corresponding stops. You can also comment each graph. You can see the history of all comments made. You can click on one comment to go to the corresponding graph. **Creative edition:** Below the TimeTable there is a scatter plot that shows all the stops for all buses for the selected route, distributed depending on their epoch time.
